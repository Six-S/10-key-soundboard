# 10-key-soundboard

A small utility that can be used to make a small soundboard using a 10 key.

This program intended to be used on Debian Linux, I haven't really messed with any other OS's because I don't use any other OS's.

Listening to and recording our keypresses requires root, but the libraries necessary to play the sounds won't work as root - hence the queue system and overengineering.

Run `keystrokes.py` as root. :grimacing:
